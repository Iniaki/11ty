As first raised in the Customer Community [here](https://www.androidenterprise.community/t5/community-feedback/zero-touch-customer-api-terms-of-service-error-403-permission/td-p/3946), the customer zero-touch solution has a new terms of service published, which will cause the API to throw an error 403 (unauthorised).

To resolve this, an admin or owner must [log into the zero-touch customer portal](https://partner.android.com/zerotouch) and accept the new ToS.
