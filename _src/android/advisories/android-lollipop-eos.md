Google has ended support for Google Play Services on Android Lollipop üç≠.

At 10 years old, it's well past its usable life, but the ~1% of active devices still running 5.x today - if not upgraded to a later version - will no longer receive what is considered the last remaining olive branch from Google offering compatibility and functionality as a provider of both first-party services, as well as SDKs & libraries for app support within the ecosystem.

Android 5.0 was a pivotal release for Android. While most will know it for the introduction of Material Design, it was the release that introduced Android for Work and the work profile through the integration of Divide (throwback video below!).

Any organisations still using certified Lollipop devices must move to a later Android version to ensure continued support and stability of corporate apps & services.. if the loss of security updates, kernel support, and app support already weren't reason enough.
