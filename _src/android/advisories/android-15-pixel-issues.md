Android 15 [launched officially](https://blog.google/products/android/android-15/) for Pixel on October 15th. 

I've been running through standard enterprise validation, ensuring to include the new Private Space feature given its cohabitation with enterprise functionality, and unlike Pixels of yonder, the enterprise functionality this year has led to more than one eyebrow raise.

If you're deploying Pixel 9 with Android 15 to your estate, here are some (non-exhaustive) issues to be aware of:

## Company owned managed profile and vital apps

During the provisioning and setup flow, users are deferred to the setup wizard to add a personal account and set up their device normally. During this, the [PAI](https://bayton.org/blog/2024/03/play-auto-install/) screen offers Googles suite of applications.

When permitting installation of these apps, both **Pixel Studio** and **Pixel Screenshots** find their way into the managed work profile once installed, and it is not possible to remove them. 

Via policy the following also has no effect on the appearance of these apps within the profile:

```json
{
    "packageName": "com.google.android.apps.pixel.agent",
    "installType": "BLOCKED"
},
{
    "packageName": "com.google.android.apps.pixel.creativeassistant",
    "installType": "BLOCKED"
}
```

It's unusual to see apps pop into the profile after provisioning, which suggests to me the [vital apps config](/android/what-are-vital-apps/) isn't to blame directly, but nonetheless, a configuration _somewhere_ is leading to this:

### Workaround

1. These apps can be disabled from the work profile with a long-press (from app drawer) > App info > Disable 
2. You can also instruct users to deselect the default apps during personal setup at the appropriate screen.

## Delegated scopes undetectable in the work profile

One affecting me directly as I spend more time adding delegated admin features to [PACKAGE SEARCH](/projects/package-search) and [MANAGED INFO](/projects/managed-info), it's seemingly not possible to fetch managed scopes from within the work profile in 15. I've tested this again in the company owned work profile and deployment scenario. When calling:

```kotlin
val dpm = context.getSystemService(Context.DEVICE_POLICY_SERVICE) as DevicePolicyManager
val delegatedScopes = dpm.getDelegatedScopes(null, context.packageName)
```

The expected response if a scope has been delegated is `[CERT_INSTALL]` (for example). What returns instead is `[]`. 

In testing on a Pixel running Android 14, I faced no issue from within the work profile. Likewise on 15 this works perfectly fine from the parent profile, in a fully managed deployment scenario. Below are two pixels, one on 14 and one on 15 leveraging the exact same policy:

(Taken from a video submission to Google, hence the quality).

### Workaround

Nothing I'm aware of just yet. 

This has been escalated to Android engineering,

## Application of personal Play Store policies to the Private Space 

Another COPE issue, the documentation suggests `personalUsagePolicies` for `personalPlayStoreMode` that define application availability within the parent profile of a company owned work profile device are also applicable to the Play Store within the Private Space.

In my test case, I have applied personal use policies to my Pixel 9:

```json
"personalUsagePolicies": {
    "personalPlayStoreMode": "ALLOWLIST",
    "personalApplications": [
        {
            "packageName": "org.bayton.packagesearch",
            "installType": "AVAILABLE"
        }
    ]
},
```

Unfortunately the policy doesn't apply. The below GIF shows the correct application in the personal Play Store, but the Private Space Play Store does not respect the policy applied:

![play store mode private space](https://cdn.bayton.org/uploads/2024/2024-10-24_13.50.52.gif)

### Workaround

Don't permit Private Space until this is fixed, if this is a concern. This is with Android Engineering, and a Google Play update is expected to resolve this in due course.

## Disappearance of distributed applications when personal Play Store mode set

After enrolment - once more in the company owned, work profile deployment scenario - setting a personal Play Store policy leads to the removal of `PREINSTALLED` applications within the work profile, preventing their reinstallation. Here's an overview on a newly-enrolled device:

In my testing, the application _may_ return at a later point, but it risks disappearance once more when the policy updates.

The replication steps, if the video isn't your cup of tea, are:

1. Enrol a device into a company owned, work profile deployment scenario
2. Set a personal usage policy for Play Store mode, I chose allowlist.
3. Installed applications in the work profile vanish.

### Workaround

None I'm aware of at the moment.

This has been escalated to Android Engineering.

## Reinforcing the need to test & validate

It's not unusual to find issues with new releases, and these examples prove yet again the importance of testing and validating all of your organisation's managed device use cases before rolling out a major release or brand-new device.
