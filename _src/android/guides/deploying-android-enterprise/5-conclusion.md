Building a mobility strategy is no straightforward task, nor is it finite; as the needs of the business change and the industry moves forward, adjusting the strategy as and when necessary, and reviewing it frequently in between, will guarantee a well-rounded and successful approach to enterprise mobility.

With a strategy in place, employees across the organisation can benefit from more security, flexibility and autonomy when undertaking their responsibilities, leading to a more productive workforce that can work from anywhere and at any time.

With Android offering market-leading solutions that empower end-users to do their best work while prioritising a healthy work-life balance with the ability to turn work _off_ at the swipe of a toggle, everyone benefits.

For organisations, finding the right device in the right form factor at the right price is a key benefit of investing in the Android ecosystem, and recognised for providing the highest number of security controls with the most robust isolation and kernel security on the market, Android is a dependable and viable solution for enterprise use.
