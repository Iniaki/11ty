Enterprise Mobility is a key area of focus for businesses; with mobile usage exceeding traditional PC and laptop usage in recent years, it’s imperative that organisations take this topic very seriously.

Android devices have generated an impressive and consistent XX% of business shipments over recent years, with Gartner predicting XX million shipments in 2020. Despite the incredible number of Android devices finding their way into business, only roughly XX% are considered under management, thereby resulting in a staggering number of organisations the world over yet to benefit from Android Enterprise.

The Bayton guide to deploying Android Enterprise has been put together to help organisations understand and develop an Android-based mobility strategy that is well-rounded, thoughtful and beneficial to the business by breaking down a number of key considerations across several areas of focus. The guide touches on device selection, project planning, security, troubleshooting and more.

This guide will help and encourage organisations to better understand the mobile landscape, the need for a mobility strategy, the requirement for a good balance between strong security and user convenience and how best to leverage Android devices whilst ensuring they’re secure, managed, and provide the best experience possible to promote productive use.

This guide is designed to target organisations across several stages of a mobility journey, and thusly it may be sensible to skip sections as required.
