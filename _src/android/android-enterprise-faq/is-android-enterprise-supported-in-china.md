Android Enterprise is not officially supported in mainland China due to restrictions on Google services, which affects essential functionalities such as account management, app distribution, and in-built security services. In fact, there are [multiple countries](https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/6270910?hl=en) not officially supported.

For organisations operating in these countries, leveraging existing solutions that support AOSP or closed-network enrolment can be a viable alternative. Solutions like Workspace ONE UEM and Microsoft Intune offer support for these approaches. Notably a considerable amount of management capability will be lost without full Android Enterprise management, leaving only on-device API support (restrictions) or any value-adds the respective platforms offer atop this, such as APK deployment.
