[AMAPI release notes for May](https://developers.google.com/android/management/release-notes) were dropped last week, but nothing had hit the API so I opted to hold off on talking about it.

Until today 😁

As of this afternoon we have the following changes to AMAPI, including a couple of things referenced at the summit 👀

`userControlSettings`

Allows end users to undertake actions such as force-stopping or clearing app data. This is a per-app setting.

In testing the experience was a little mixed. I with user control disabled I was still able to go into app info > storage and clear cache, but as the GIF shows it's definitely doing _something_.

`PERSONAL_USAGE_DISALLOWED_USERLESS`

Allowing personal use has been pretty binary from the start, however with BTE - or Customer sign-up, as Google will be referring to it publicly, some new options will be introduced. 

I've referenced in *What's new (so far) for enterprise in Android 15* (linked below) the inclusion of another `allowPersonalUsage` option, `DEDICATED_DEVICE` which will also allow provisioning customisation for dedicated devices, but that's not available to us just yet.. 

[https://bayton.org/blog/2024/04/new-for-enterprise-android-15/#deeper-dedicated-device-experience-management](/blog/2024/04/new-for-enterprise-android-15/#deeper-dedicated-device-experience-management)

You'll be pleased (maybe?) to know setting `PERSONAL_USAGE_DISALLOWED_USERLESS` today has no impact on provisioning, at least ahead of BTE going _live-live_, it's more of a flag to tell AMAPI the device enrolling is userless - a kiosk or dedicated device with no capacity for personal use or corporate authentication, in fact I recorded the provisioning process in the following (low quality) GIF, sped up for convenience:

Finally, 

> The get and list methods for enrollmentTokens now return populated value, qrCode, and allowPersonalUsage fields.

I don't see this happening, at least not yet via the API explorer. This'll be great when it does happen though; I'll gladly sacrifice a few additional calls to the API to fetch enrolment token details rather than fuss over storing and managing them within a database I have to maintain, so I'm happy with that 😁
