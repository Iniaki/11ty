Did you hear? From Android 15, Samsung are restricting several Knox APIs for applications that aren't calling them as a device or policy owner, limiting capabilities previously open for non-EMM use cases to only those under management.

Samsung plan to fully restrict all Knox APIs with Android 16 next year. 

While I haven't seen prolific use of non-AE use cases for Knox recently, I'm certainly aware of vendors leaning on the APIs for uses that aren't directly management-related. MTD, consumer AV, or remote desktop apps being some that come to mind.

Obviously it needed to be done at some point to finally fully phase out DA management, but I do wonder what sort of impact this will actually have.
