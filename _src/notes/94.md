Off the back of the news of NinjaOne launching MDM today (link: [https://www.ninjaone.com/press/mobile-device-management/](https://www.ninjaone.com/press/mobile-device-management/)), I'm pleased to say I've made the jump back in to full time employment, leading Google Ecosystem product for NinjaOne MDM ðŸŽ‰

I'm super proud of the work done by our teams to get this up and running so rapidly, and while today's announcement introduces Android and iOS support, work is already underway to expand modern management to other operating systems. Keep your eyes peeled ðŸ‘€.
