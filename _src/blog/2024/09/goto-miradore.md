Back in 2014, I discovered Miradore, a then-emerging Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution that promised a robust set of features for managing Android devices. My initial review, [Miradore Online: Free MDM](https://bayton.org/blog/2014/07/miradore-online-free-mdm/), highlighted the platform's potential and its generous free tier, which made it stand out in a market crowded with costly alternatives. 

Over the years, I revisited Miradore multiple times, documenting its growth and the expansion of its feature set in articles like [Miradore Online MDM Review: A Second Look](https://bayton.org/blog/2015/03/miradore-online-mdm-review-a-second-look/) and [Miradore Online MDM: Expanding Management with Subscriptions](https://bayton.org/blog/2016/02/miradore-online-mdm-expanding-management-with-subscriptions/).

Fast-forward to 2022, when Miradore announced its acquisition by Goto, I met the news with cautious optimism. Goto, a company known for its suite of remote work tools, seemed like a reasonably safe choice to nurture Miradore's growth. Official announcements from both parties, such as [Goto Acquires Miradore](https://www.goto.com/blog/goto-acquires-miradore) and [Miradore Acquired by Goto: What Happens Next?](https://www.miradore.com/blog/miradore-acquired-by-goto-what-happens-next/), painted a rosy picture of enhanced resources and expanded capabilities.

However, the honeymoon period is certainly over now. Since the acquisition, Goto has more and more shown its disdain for Miradore's core USP, systematically stripping away key features from the free tier and fundamentally altering the product's value proposition and accessibility.

## The Erosion of the Free Tier

Last December, a significant change came when Goto removed essential functionalities from the free plan. Email configuration, VPN setup, Wi-Fi settings, contacts management, and mail were no longer accessible without a paid subscription. Details of these changes weren't outlined in Miradore's release notes, instead opting to send direct emails to certain customers only. I personally heard about it second-hand. Nevertheless, the impact was felt by long-time users who had integrated these features into their device management workflows.

The situation worsened considerably in April. Goto further restricted the free tier by limiting mass actions — a cornerstone feature for any MDM solution. According to the [official announcement](https://www.miradore.com/knowledge/releases/premium-plus-trial-and-changes-to-the-free-plan/):

- **Deploy configuration profiles one device at a time**
- **Synchronize a single device at a time**

This effectively crippled the efficiency that Miradore once offered. Administrators now have to perform repetitive tasks individually for each device, a tedious process that is impractical for organisations managing more than a handful of devices.

But Goto isn't finished. Later this year, they have announced plans to cap the number of devices on the free plan to 50, down from unlimited. The forthcoming changes were communicated through another [release note](https://www.miradore.com/knowledge/releases/changes-to-miradores-free-plan-device-limit/) recently.

## The Impact on organisations

These cumulative changes have made Miradore's free tier not just limited but virtually unusable for organisations of any moderate size and/or complexity.

If you're going to enforce limits, you'd be wise typically to pick a path - limited licences, or limited functionality. The removal of both critical features and the imposition of device limits is a double-whammy that offers the worst of both worlds. I'd ask how they expect groups on the free tier to remain loyal to a platform driven by decisions that scream "we don't want you here", but it seems apparent they haven't considered the question. 

As someone who has championed Miradore for nearly a decade, I find this trajectory disheartening. The platform's Unique Selling Proposition (USP) was its robust free tier, which allowed organisations — especially smaller groups and communities with tight budgets — to manage their Android devices effectively without incurring additional costs, and I have directed hobbyists, charities, and indeed potential customers their way for years to benefit from this in order to take a first step into the enterprise management ecosystem.

Goto's strategy appears to be undermining this USP entirely. By going down the path they've chosen, they're alienating the very user base that helped Miradore grow. It's a puzzling move, especially when considering that the MDM market is more competitive than ever.

## Conclusion

Miradore's journey from a promising entry point into device management to its current state of limited functionality on a finite number of devices is a cautionary tale of how acquisitions can sometimes erode the very qualities that gave a product its place in a market. Goto's incremental worsening of their product will fundamentally change what Miradore offers, making it less appealing to organisations that may have used it as a jumping point into a higher tier at a later date, and more likely to be bundled with competing platforms in the decision-making process, unfortunately some with more compelling trial / free tiers than Miradore will soon offer.
