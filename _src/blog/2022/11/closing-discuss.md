After a bit of thought, I've decided to shut down the [Discuss](https://discuss.bayton.org) comments platform. 

My intentions were to build a community site with [Discourse](https://discourse.org) hooked in to the main website to both act as a comments platform for the posts and docs I publish, and slowly become a bit of a standalone forum for general discussion and support.

After a few years and admittedly very little promotion of the platform on my part, the costs of running _another_ server separate from the main website just for this no longer make sense.

Going forward I'm not planning on implementing a comments system back into the main website since people can and do reach me on various forms of social media or via email on a regular basis, and there are better communities to find me lurking for support than my forum, such as:

- [Android Enterprise Help Community](https://support.google.com/work/android/community)
- [EMM.how](https://emm.how)
- [Mobile Pros Discord Community](https://mobilepros.org)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidenterprise/)
- You can also ask for content or raise issues with docs/etc on [GitHub](https://github.com/jasonbayton/11ty/discussions) where I keep the source to this website

All user data on the Discuss site will be deleted, I do not plan to migrate to anything else at this time.
