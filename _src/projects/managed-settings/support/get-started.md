Out of the box, MANAGED SETTINGS comes with no restrictions set on available settings offered. Without any configuration, the application will function to enable access to all supported Settings intents.

</div>

## Install the application

MANAGED SETTINGS is available as a public app on Google Play, which means locating the application for installation within your EMM platform of choice is quick and simple. 

You can view it on the Play Store, here: 

<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.bayton.managedsettings'><img alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png' width="200px"/></a>

To install it for enterprise management, log in to your EMM platform, navigate to the area where applications are configured and search the managed Google Play iFrame for the app name **MANAGED SETTINGS**. Alternatively search on the package name: `org.bayton.managedsettings`. 

## Configure the application

1. Once selected, open the application configuration for MANAGED SETTINGS, and switch to managed configuration setup.
2. You may now de-select any Settings intents you don't wish to provide access to, define a support email address, and optionally a support message.

<div class="callout">
<div class="callout-heading">Formatting support messages</div>

FYI, the support message field supports HTML! You may use the following HTML tags: 

- `<P>` - HTML paragraph 
- `<A>` - HTML link
- `<B>` - HTML bold
- `<I>` - HTML italic

Feel free to customise this message as desired, or simply input a string.

</div>

Once configured and ready to deploy, push the application to desired devices.
