## MANAGED SETTINGS

MANAGED SETTINGS offers organisations a means of providing a limited device Settings experience, preventing over-exposing device settings that should not be visible or interactive for managed device end users.

Perfect for Kiosk deployment scenarios, or simply limiting the settings available to fully managed devices.
