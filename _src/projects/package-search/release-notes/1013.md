**New features**

- Detect & badge applications that are available in other user profiles (work profile, secondary user)
  - Android doesn't guarantee which user exists under which ID, and while it's a reasonable assumption to assume userID 10+ for work profile users, I'm intentionally avoiding mislabelling applications that may be running in secondary, guest, ephemeral, or work profile users.
- Added sort by package name
- Add a loading state to reduce initial app launch delay
  - This includes placeholder cards with a loading animation, and two new states of `dataReady` and `fullyLoaded` to support milestones on loading large application catalogues
  - On a device with 550 applications, loading takes about 4 seconds for all information to filter through
  - It's configured to begin showing available apps from about 50% processed, so for devices with several hundred more apps installed than the 550 I've tested, the delay will be shortened at the cost of minor UI jumps as items continue to load in
- Show user-installed apps in unavailable state
  - This accounts for applications installed via other users/profiles from Google Play
- Export to CSV
  
**Fixes**

- `enabledState` is the correct colour again
- Attempts to improve performance
  - Moved application card loading to a background handler
  - Added a catch for critical errors accessing packages
- Improved readability in unavailable search results text
- Prevent DOS from application state changes (installs, uninstalls, updates)
- Removed logic waiting for a minimum number of apps to show the app list, as in some filters the number shown is legitimately below that of the minimum set to view app cards
- Fixed a bug using case as a valid sort component
- Fixed a bug causing incorrect package names to be assigned to cards on long-press (copy) activity
