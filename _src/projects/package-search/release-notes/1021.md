**Features & improvements**

- Implement app grid & large screen support
  - Though some aspects of PACKAGE SEARCH aren't yet fully optimised for tablet/large screen use (see: settings) the main app grid should now be fully responsive. Feedback welcome!
- Enable long press on app detail page for copying
  - Though first starting with card exports, it's now possible to just touch & hold to highlight & copy data too. The cards supporting long-press to copy still only do this
- Add credits for volunteers
- Add French (thanks Thomas!) 
- Update German (thanks Daniel!)

**Fixes**

- Fix layout for small DPI devices
  - The dual-column approach wasn't working well on devices with very small screens, large display rendering, or too-large fonts. For these scenarios the card should now switch back to single-column
- Fixed the DPM receiver
