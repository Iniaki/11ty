PACKAGE SEARCH allows for quick and easy extraction of application package names and pertinent application information.

Android Enterprise-enabled organisations can effortlessly deploy PACKAGE SEARCH not only to fetch an application's package name, but also:

- Install date
- Last update
- Version names and version codes
- App status
- App type (system, user)
- and more.

## Get started

You can find the app publicly here:
