PACKAGE SEARCH is brand new, so much so I haven't done the âœ¨marketingâœ¨ just yet. There's some basic information below, and if you want to know how this area of the site will look shortly, check out [MANAGED SETTINGS](/projects/managed-settings/)

ðŸ‘‹ Thanks!

PACKAGE SEARCH allows for quick and easy extraction of application package names and pertinent application information.

Android Enterprise-enabled organisations can effortlessly deploy PACKAGE SEARCH not only to fetch an application's package name, but also:

- Install date
- Last update
- Version names and version codes
- App status
- App type (system, user)
- and more.

## Get started

You can find the app publicly here:

<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.bayton.packagesearch'><img alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png' width="200px"/></a>

## Help & support
