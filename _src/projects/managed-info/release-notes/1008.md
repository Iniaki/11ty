**Features & improvements**

- Implemented the QUERY ALL PACKAGES permission to offer app layouts within MANAGED INFO
- Added two kiosk-style application cards, one as an app grid similar to a kiosk, and the other an icon & message. This brings card support to 4 options:
  - Vertical HTML-enabled text card
  - Horizontal HTML-enabled text card
  - Application card
  - App grid card
- Added network info card, you can now view radios, network information, and more. This adds the ACCESS_WIFI_STATE permission to MANAGED INFO
- Added device DPI to device info 
- Rebuilt the custom card config. Due to Google limitations custom cards of all types are configured outside of Customisation Settings in the Managed Config payload, but remain a licensed feature.
 
**Fixes**

- Fixed numerous small layout bugs
- Fixed settings screen scroll
- Fixed activation server errors
