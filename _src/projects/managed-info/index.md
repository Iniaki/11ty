**MANAGED INFO is an information, or support, utility designed to provide managed Android device users with a simple interface configured with actions, support information, and device details.**

## What does MANAGED INFO do?

MANAGED INFO allows an administrator to configure:

- Quick actions, for calling, emailing, browsing a website, or pulling up a configured location
- Organisation messages, with basic HTML support, allowing for rich, admin-defined messaging in-app
- Contact information
- Device details

## Who is MANAGED INFO for?

Useful in a multi-app kiosk environment as a means of providing help & support information, but equally offers typical knowledge worker deployment scenarios direct access to organisation-defined information at the tap of an icon.

## What does MANAGED INFO cost?

MANAGED INFO is a **free** application. I may add customisation options to the application, akin to MANAGED SETTINGS, in future. This depends on demand. 
If desired, MANAGED INFO can be organisation-branded as a custom application. Please do get in touch if interested.

## Get started

You can find the app publicly here:

Alternatively, you can submit [feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYQrOPM0dKwCmcSjfxgoK2rQvhQXXyw2pk9nMqYBn0F2IhRw/viewform?usp=sf_link), post to the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/7VzRZWVkht), or tag me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jasonbayton). 

I can also offer additional priority support for an annual recurring fee, offering faster and more in-depth support, with additional discounts on my [consultancy rate](/support). Details can be found [here]([/projects/managed-settings/pricing/#support-priority-support) (via MANAGED SETTINGS pricing).
